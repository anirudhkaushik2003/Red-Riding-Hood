# Red-Riding-Hood

A 2d platformer Game

## Controls

- <kbd>SPACE</kbd>: jump
- <kbd>Right_arrow</kbd>: move right
- <kbd>Left_arrow</kbd>: move left

## Attacking

- <kbd>W</kbd>: shoot arrows :bow_and_arrow:
- <kbd>Q</kbd>: use light attack :knife:

## Interactive

- <kbd>E</kbd>: Pick flowers
- <kbd>F</kbd>: Plant flowers

## Note:

Pick up a flower :sunflower: and plant it again to heal :hospital:

## Enemies

The minotaurs are the primary antagonist of the game. They don't want to let Red Riding Hood pass through the forest. The minotaurs are extremely aggressive and if they detect you, they'll chase you around. It is better to attack them from a safe distance as they do a significant amount of damage per hit. They are fast and can jump over obstacles to chase you. Avoid confronting a group of minotaurs and remember to heal if you are low on health.

The wizards are extremely powerful and fast and can kill you in two hits, use stacked powerups to defeat them.

The flying goblins are the only flying mob in the game and coding their AI was extremely difficult to show almost random and realistic flight patterns in idle behavior

The objective of the game is to make it through the forest alive while collecting as many flowers as possible for Granny.

A new and random world is generated each time you play the game with completely random difficulty, terrain, object and enemy generation. This is done using simplex noise and a greedy and stack based algorithm over a very large 2d matrix.

## Powerups

- <kbd>Arrow refil</kbd>
- <kbd>Arrow attack damage x4</kbd>
- <kbd>Shoot 3x arrows at once</kbd>

## Features
- My project is centred around the creation of a 2d platformer game 
using algorithms. The game uses algorithms for the generation of a 
new and random world each time as discussed in the comic strip and 
concept map.

- To know more about the method and my though process kindly refer to the comic strip and conecpt map pdf.
